## Supervised Learning - Classification Problem

## Project: Module 13 submission

## Description:
- Develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model to accurately detect spam emails. Create two classification models (Logistic regression model and Random Forest model), to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. 

## Libraries:
    - pandas
    - sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.preprocessing
    
## Input dataset:
- Contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam.

## Goal: 
- Create two classification models, split data into training and testing sets, fit the training data, and evaluate which model performs better at detecting spam.
    - Logistic Regression Model
    - Random Forest Model

## Jupyter notebook: 
- spam_detector.ipynb

## Output:
Make an initial prediction and test results against the initial judgement, as to which model fared better.
The results show that Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression. This compared favorably with my predictions. Most likely the data was not linear and spam detection logic is amenable to rules.
